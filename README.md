# Hangman_game

## Project one: Hangman Game

### Once the page is loaded players can start the game by clicking on the keyboard with every letter that is clicked it will let you know if you missed by adding a body part to the hangman frame. If the letter matches a letter in the word the letter will appear in the space that that matches it in the word without adding a body part. Once the game is over you can click on new word or refresh the page and it will give you a new word so you can continue to still play the game.
